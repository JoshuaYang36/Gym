# Gym

We are working on a user active interface that will allow users to track their progress during workouts. 

Users will be able to input the name of the workout, the repetitions and sets accomplished, as well as the weight 
all within the week they choose.

Our "weeks" are represented by seperate SQLite Databases currently, but will be changed to multiple tables within one
database. We will be either using Python built in GUI builder or a web element for our front end.
